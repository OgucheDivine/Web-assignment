Yes, there were several issues with the original code:
JavaScript:
Unused Return Value: In the checker function, the return value was not used. Instead, consider updating the src attribute directly.
Global Variables: Variables like col_no were global, which can lead to naming conflicts. Consider wrapping them in a scope or using a more modular approach.
Inline Event Handlers: Using inline event handlers like onclick and onkeydown can make code harder to maintain. Instead, use addEventListener in JavaScript.
Magic Numbers: Values like 2.2% and 1.9% were used directly in the code. Consider defining them as constants or variables for clarity.
HTML:
Invalid Heading Tag: The <heading> tag is not a valid HTML tag. Instead, use <header> or simply <h1> for headings.
Script Tag Placement: The script tag was placed in the <head> section. Consider moving it to the end of the <body> for better performance.
CSS:
Redundant Styles: Some styles, like border: hidden, were unnecessary. Consider removing them for simplicity.
Other Issues:
Code Organization: The code was not separated into logical sections or files, making it harder to maintain.
Naming Conventions: Variable and function names could be more descriptive and consistent.
Error Handling: The code did not handle potential errors, such as invalid input or missing elements.
By addressing these issues, the refactored code becomes more maintainable, efficient, and easier to understand.
